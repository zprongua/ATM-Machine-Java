# ATM-Machine

This Project is to make an Automated Teller Machine with user's Account Number, Pin, and bank (checking and saving) accounts.
Using this data, users can withdraw, deposit, and view their account balance.

Using the existing code, add the following functionality.

## Additions

- Add the ability to show statement of all your account balances
- Add ability to have multiple accounts within the ATM
- Add a means to SAVE all account data to a file used by the ATM
  - Keep state of account(s) between runnings of ATM
- Add a means to LOG all transaction data to a logfile

You may have to remind yourself how to add `pom.xml` file and make it a Java project in your IDE.
